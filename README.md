**Employee Management**

it is a standalone console based application, where I created few files as db.sql, db_config.py, employe_management.py, main.py where all files are important.
the code works absolutly fine. 

In db_config.py where username and password should be given according to your mysql name and password
username="your_username"
password="your_password"
in my case the username is root and password is Deepak@2003
